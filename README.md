## *Description*
DAMNation is an application for analyzing data produced by DAM (Drosophila Activity Monitor) assays. DAMNation currently analyzes sleep and locomotor activity, with future additions planned. It runs in the cloud and can be accessed [here](https://bigmonty12.shinyapps.io/DAMNation/) or deployed locally after pulling this repository. No information is collected from users or their data. Summary statistics, bout information, and graphs are all generated from a raw DAM output .txt file.
